        Cross-platform: Node.js can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. 
        Event-driven: Node.js uses an event-driven architecture with asynchronous I/O to optimize throughput and scalability. 
        JavaScript everywhere: Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript for both server-side and client-side programming. 
        Built on V8: Node.js is built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. 
        Community-driven: Node.js is open source, so it's free to use and constantly being improved by a global community of developers. 
        Used by big names: Many big names like Netflix, Uber, Paypal, and LinkedIn use Node.js.
